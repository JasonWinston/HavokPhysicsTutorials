HavokPhysicsTutorials
=====================
This is the supporting repository for my Havok Physics Engine Tutorial Series available here: http://mmmovania.blogspot.com/2014/03/havok-physics-engine-tutorial-series.html. The source code is tested using VisualStudio 2012 on Windows 7 machine. 

Covered Tutorials
-----------------
Currently, the tutorials cover
* How to setup Visual Studio 2012 with the latest free Havok Physics SDK available from here: http://www.havok.com/try-havok
* Creating a simple box rigid body that falls down and collides with the ground plane
* Creating multiple rigid bodies that falls down and collides with the ground plane
* Picking rigid bodies using the mouse 
* Creating simple distance constraints to limit movement of rigid bodies
* Creating Chain by linking rigid bodies with a pair of distance constraints
* Creating Cloth using distance constraints

Dependencies
============
The only dependency for this project is the freeglut library that can be obtained from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download. The latest version should work fine. The current versin 2.8.1 was used for these tutorials. OpenGL 2.0 version was used enabling a wider audience to compile and run these tutorials

Setting up Visual Studio 2012
=============================
Refer to the first tutorial available here: http://mmmovania.blogspot.com/2014/03/havok-physics-engine-tutorial-series.html.
