HavokPhysicsTutorials
=====================
This is the supporintg repository for my Havok Physics Engine Tutorial Series available here: http://mmmovania.blogspot.com/2014/03/havok-physics-engine-tutorial-series.html. The source code is build using VisualStudio 2012 on Windows 7. 

Dependencies
============
The only dependency for this project is the freeglut library that can be obtained from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download. The latest version should work fine. The current versin 2.8.1 was used for these tutorials.

Setting up Visual Studio 2012

Refer to the first tutorial available here: http://mmmovania.blogspot.com/2014/03/havok-physics-engine-tutorial-series.html.
